<p>Effective time spent on project: 9 Hours (3 days, 3 hours each day)</br>
This was an interesting beginner task for testing/training fundamental microcontroller programming concepts.
I thoroughly enjoyed the flow of wiring components and writing the control software for the two wheeled robot.

<p>
The project is created and simulated in tinkerCAD (a free, online 3D modeling program that runs in a web browser).</br>The potentiometer controls the speed of the motors when the circuit is in any of the 4 drive modes (Forwards, Backwards, Left, Right). When no switches are closed, the motors are set to neutral.
